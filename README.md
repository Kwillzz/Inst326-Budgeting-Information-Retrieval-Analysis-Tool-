Members: Abbas Mehdi, Connor Lehfeldt, Kurt Wills
Each member is expected to contribute to everything equally

Our goal is to build a computer program designed to help monitor income and spending habits on a monthly and yearly basis and construct a budget around your current income.

People often struggle with monitoring their income regularly, staying on a consistent saving schedule, complex budgeting applications, lack of spending awareness, remembering to pay cards/bills/subscriptions, and building a budget in general.

Contribution guidelines for team members:
-Each member is expected to contribute equally and in a way that makes it clear on the github blame that each person actually did their part. (EX shouldn't copy and paste others code to transfer it from one file to another, so the TAs know who contributed what. Instead, members should notify other members about what code should be put where if it was put in an improper location so that blame can properly be attributed)
-Each member should communicate if they cannot do something or if they need help with something, whether due to limitations of their own coding capabilities, or due to technical difficulties that prevent them from coding and pushing to the repository.
-If members use AI, they should use the proper documentation procedures for usage of AI for whatever specific purpose they used it for, as outlined by the professor.
-Each member should contribute their part in a timely fashion.
